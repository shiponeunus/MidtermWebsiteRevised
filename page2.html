  <p class="ikeacaption3"> IKEA is known for its vision to deliver great design that improves the everyday life of someone
    who loves afforable, reliable, functional, and forward-thinking products. In the year 2086, IKEA decided to
    experiment with different styles of furniture by collaborating with a wide-range of artists and designers
    for their new program, "IKEA TOMORROW".<br> <br>
    IKEA hired us to create a capsule collection for this new program. As apart of our capsule collection, we created an installation in Almhult,Sweden, showcasing our proposal,'Room 2086', for "IKEA TOMORROW".
    For this capsule, we designed a grid pattered rug, octogon shaped coffee table, concrete couch, and chair-bench-sectional hybrid with desk attached.
    We experimented with shape, material, and color palette in our design of essential home furniture pieces. This collaboration merges
    C(V)L's vision for creating unconvention designs and IKEA's vision for democratic design.</p>
